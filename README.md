  <h3 align="center">Timer Quiz!</h3>

  <p align="center">
    A timed quiz app aimed at novice developers. Start with 90 seconds, and if you answer wrong, you lose 10 seconds! When there are no questions left or the time is 0, the game is over. Save your highscores, make a friend try and then compare scores! </p>
    <p align="center"> 
    Current bugs include: 
  <ul> 
    <li> When an incorrect answer is given, 10 seconds should be subtracted from the running timer. This does not happen.
      <li> Highscore page does not currently load any of the highscores saved in localStorage.
       </ul>
